# Quantum Simulation of the Quantum Connectome

This repository contains the framework for quantum simulations of the quantum connectome using tensor network methods. The primary objective is to compute the **Mental Stress Tensor (MST)**, a novel representation of cognitive and emotional states derived from quantum simulations of the connectome.

## Overview

The **Quantum Simulation of the Quantum Connectome** project leverages advanced quantum mechanics and tensor network methods to model and simulate the brain's cognitive dynamics. By simulating the time evolution of the quantum connectome, the framework provides insights into neural states and computes the Mental Stress Tensor (MST) for applications in neuroscience, mental health, and cognitive science.
